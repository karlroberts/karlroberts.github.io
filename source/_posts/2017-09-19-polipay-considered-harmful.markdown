Maybe I'm late to the party but I was just attempting to purchase some bitcoin from [coinspot](http://www.coinspot.com.au) and the default payment mechanism was to use [POLi payments](https://www.polipayments.com/). Their website asked me to enter my online banking credentials. It was at this point that all my security warning senses spiked and my hackels went up.

I immediatly backed out and did a quick investigation. I can not beleive my eyes. It seems to go against everything we should do to protect our assets on the web.

How is this legitimate!? Read on to see what I found out. Maybe you can help explain why people think this is a safe thing to do online?

### What is POLi payments?. 
At first glance the POLi website looks pretty impressive. Nice and slick. The Autralia Post logo is prominantly displayed at the top of the page adding an air or respectability.

POLi Payments Pty Ltd is an online payment system in Australia and New Zealand.

In October 2014 POLi payments (formally Centricom Pty Ltd) [was aquired](https://au.linkedin.com/company/poli-payments) by [SecurePay Holdings](https://www.directory.gov.au/portfolios/communications-and-arts/australian-postal-corporation/securepay-holdings-pty-ltd) is a Australia Post controlled holding company for SecurePay Pty Ltd, an entity which provides online payment services.

POLi enables consumers to pay for goods or services directly from a merchant's website without the need for a credit card, but by using a direct connection to the user's internet banking.

### Why Would you use POLi payments
First of all, it's fast. Payment is immediate, I dson't have to wait a few days like with BPay for my money to clear, so for anyone whowants to get those Bitcoins now while the price is right it seems like a good thing.

But Credit Card or charge card, (eg Visa or MasterCard) payments are immediate too so why not use that? After all If I pay with a CreditCard I get purchase protection, I am dealing with the Credit card company not the vendor, so if the goods dont arrive my account gets re-credited and the Credit Card company goes after the vendor. They have more clout then me and I don't have to chase a dodgy vendor for my goods.

All of that is great, but it comes at a cost. Often there is a few percents of surcharge to use a Credit card that gets passed down to the  cutomer.

Poli payments are free to the user. There are no charges to the user paying for goods this way.
