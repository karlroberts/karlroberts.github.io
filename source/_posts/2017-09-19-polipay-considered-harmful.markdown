Maybe I'm late to the party but I was just attempting to purchase some bitcoin from [coinspot](http://www.coinspot.com.au) and the default payment mechanism was to use [POLi payments](https://www.polipayments.com/). Their website asked me to enter my online banking credentials. It was at this point that all my security warning senses spiked and my hackels went up.

I immediatly backed out and did a quick investigation. I can not beleive my eyes. It seems to go against everything we should do to protect our assets on the web.

How is this legitimate!? Read on to see what I found out. Maybe you can help explain why people think this is a safe thing to do online?
