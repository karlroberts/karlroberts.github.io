The other day I was watering the garden in the evening, while carrying Bille. It was just before Billie's bath time.

Billie looked up, pointed and said, "'zat?". She can't properly speak yet but I looked where she was pointing and interpreted her utterance as "what's that?"

"It's the Moon, Billie!", I replied. It was forming a perfect crescent shape. "I'm so glad you saw that, Daddy likes the Moon. Do you like the Moon?", I asked her. I was trying to repeat "moon" a number of times for her to learn the new word.

"Oooo", Billie said. Her little mouth shrinking to form a small circle. Close enough, she has the word now. I'm just going to have to remember that "Oooo" is "Moon"

This morning I was feeding Billie her porridge, while reading her Babies first words book. Being distracted by the book pictures and sounds is a good way to get her to just open her mouth and eat rather than playing with the food and flinging it everywhere.

Anyway, next to a photo of a Bed was a drawing of some stylised stars and a crescent moon.

Billie pointed her tiny forefinger at the picture of the Moon then with her other hand pointed up to the area in the sky where she had seen the Moon and excitedly said "Oooo!"

Not only has she recognized the symbolic picture of the moon as representing the moon, she has oriented herself to point up to the place in the sky where she saw it, even though she is inside the house!

"Yes Billie", I replied just as excitedly. "We like the Moon don't we?". To which she smiled and nodded sagely.
