As a developer I've often seen (and been the culprit) of premature optimisation. Developers, in our desire to write
fast software often sacriface readability, maintainability and correctness in favour of speed.

{% blockquote Donuld Knuth https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth Computer Programming as an Art (1974) %}
Premature optimization is the root of all evil ... in programming
{% endblockquote %}

This premature optimisation effort is bad practise. It is better to have clean code and optomise where necessary after measuring everything.

In fact it may not be necessary to mess up the code to get the a fractional improovement, perhaps it is more cost effective to run on better hardware?

Like watchng grass grow we don't usually notice the ongoing benefit of the advances in computer hardware
until you get to see it in timelapse.

In this blog I have added a video to capture one such event.

I recently upgraded my laptop after 4 years of usage, and as well as the usual smug appreciation of my new hardware
I am blown away by the performcance hike. {" Double your speed with a hardware upgrade "}
check it out.

A 10 second pause is no way as distracting as a 20 second pause, allowing me to stay in context and keep coding.
