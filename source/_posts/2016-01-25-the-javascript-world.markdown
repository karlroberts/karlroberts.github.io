Javascript ecosystem, walkthrough the jungle.

When you first step into the 
Build systems Grunt gulp task managers Brocolli Brunch
common.js AMD (async modules definition) node.js Ecmascript6 modules baked in http://jsmodules.io/  http://jsmodules.io/cjs.html

npm bower browzerify -> webpack

browser incompatabilities Moderizer canIUse

Question Why does Javascript Ecosystem evolve so much?
hypothesis? is it because it's harder to refactor dynamic languages?
Spring in Java would have become Summer and Autumn in javascript land

can I proove this? look at github capture lang dynamic or static see how many contributers maintain a repo or move onto others
are replacements true forks or brand new?

Why not push back to upstream?
