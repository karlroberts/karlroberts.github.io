As marketing hype and buzzwords go __DevOps__ has got to up there with __Cloud__! Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon and in the process the real message and usefulness is getting obscured by slipshod marketing departments and snake-oil salesmen.

This is a shame as there really is a very good reason to adopt DevOps.

For the impatient the important answer is __it makes you money__. <!--more-->
Of course it also saves you time but as we know money _is_ time, so lets just say __it makes you money__.

I've recently finished working a talk on [Why is Devops?](http://docs.aws.avocadoconsulting.com.au/presales/why_is_devops/) and it brought up some interesting points that often get overlooked in the above mentioned happy-clappy marketing buzzword fever, which gets us back to a real understanding of why DevOps is useful? 

Whilst slide-decks are great in a good talk most of the detail is in the talk not the text on the slide, so this blog attempts to layout the arguments and reasoning for people who missed the talk.

### Where 

So where has DevOps come from and why do I need it?

It is my contention that DevOps is a natural evolution of Operations practice in order to deal with the strain created by the rapid pace of development activity as best Software Engineering practices evolve.
