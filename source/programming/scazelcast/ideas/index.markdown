+ Serialisation via pickling lib, no reflections
+ Linked List for immutable List
+ ResourceMonad to clear up Distributed locks via destroy(), loan pattern
  - 
+ Topic, onMessage must be and actor dispatch :-)
  -
+ to come PartitionProcessors can run ops on all stuff on a partions, make it monadic
+ trees hard to partition, why not on 5 depth partition?? or Cord  this is hard so lets sort it functionally :-) 
+ if not portable serialisation then reflectionis used to do Queries on a value, "if(age > 32)" would look up age part by reflection, poratbles dont do this the Class Def is encoded with it.
  - Pickling seems buffer
