* Akka needs to support Protocols as first class citizens
- sick of loosing context of where I am in a conversation

* Actors dont compose but they agregate to Protocols

* Need model of Partial failure eg getting Slow , so I can declare SLA as contraints and riles as what to do if step into a new SLA State.

* ie need Tolerences, so Instead of prooving correctness in distributed I can at least assert "works withn tolerence"
