# In the beginning....

There was one computer, and its name was Production. Production had a benovolent ruler called  "System Administrator". System Administrator was the administrator, programmer and user of the Production computer and he was wise.

Because there was only one computor, System Administrator did all his development and prototyping on Production. All was good. There was no such thing as deployment, beautiful code simply ran, and no-one got blamed!

Over time ruthless feudal overlords and MBA's, known simply as "The Bussiness", became interested in the power and speed of computer programs to "leverage efficiencies" and make more money.

The Bussiness was not happy that all their money making feature requests and "great ideas" were waiting for System Administrator to code them in and they began to exhort System Administrator to become more faster and more efficient.

Finally the pressure grew so strong that System Administrator was forced to split his responsibilities and he was never whole again.

In the schism, System Administrator begat two new species, Developers to work on features and helper gnomes to help him move their code offerings to Production.

The feudal Bussiness ovelords fell on the Developers. They greedily decreed that Developers would fall under their dominium that they may whip them night and day to grind out new features for the Bussiness, after all as they already owned the Typing pool and Developers were just glorified Typists.

In a short period of time enslaved Developers from different Bussiness overlords had the latest Whiz-Bang software ready for production. Unfortunatly when the helper Gnomes took it to Production, one program corrupted the other and Production crashed causing an Outage!

The Developers in fear of reprisals pointed at each other and showed that it all worked on their machines! The Bussiness unable to accept any blame on itself and unable to comprehend that their greed had corrupted the system decided to blame the System Administrator!

System Administrator was appalled at the mess. He loved his computer and knew that it was good. He was loath to let cowboy code besmirch Production any further and instigated instigated rules and Commandments to protect it. These Commandments became the Operating Proceedures that a Developers needed to adhere to to get his code to Production, and System Administrator's helper Gnomes became know as the Operations department who would religiously ensure that the Operating Proceedurs were strictly enforced.

The Schism instigated by the Bussiness was complete. Developers and Operations would forever be pulled in different directions, devlopers were tasked with createing changes in Production and Operations would attempt to  prevent all change from sullying Production's pristeen uptime.

## Dark Ages ...

Problems continued to occur. On small mis-alignment of code or requirement or one mistep and the deployment process would flatten Production. The Bussiness was worried that they may get the blame and being compleatly IT illiterate many cargo cults, monsters and mythical creatures were invented to try to explain or solve the problems. For instance it was widely belived that Gremlins attacked computers leaving Bugs everywhere which caused crashes.

It was in this chaos and misunderstanding a saviour was though to exist in the form of a ruthless deamon, called a PM, that had been spawned and risen to the top of the Tele-sales department. PM would be able to understand both the Bussiness desires and understand computer systems (after all he could use a predictive-dialing phone system) and so should be able to run am IT project or department. Or so it was thought.

Unfortunatly skilled Dev and Ops guys were expensive and hard to indoctinate
Enterprise Systems were created in an attempt to mass-produce developers and Ops guys cheaply
