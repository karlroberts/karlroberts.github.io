# In the beginning....

There was one computer, and its name was Production. Production had a benovolent ruler called  "System Administrator". System Administrator was the administrator, programmer and user of the Production computer and he was wise.

Because there was only one computor, System Administrator did all his development and prototyping on Production. All was good. There was no such thing as deployment, beautiful code simply ran, and no-one got blamed!

Over time ruthless feudal overlords and MBA's, known simply as "The Bussiness", became interested in the power and speed of computer programs to "leverage efficiencies" and make more money.

The Bussiness was not happy that all their money making feature requests and "great ideas" were waiting for System Administrator to code them in and they began to exhort System Administrator to become more faster and more efficient.

Finally the pressure grew so strong that System Administrator was forced to split his responsibilities and he was never whole again.

In the schism, System Administrator begat two new species, Developers to work on features and helper gnomes to help him move their code offerings to Production.

The feudal Bussiness ovelords fell on the Developers. They greedily decreed that Developers would fall under their dominium that they may whip them night and day to grind out new features for the Bussiness, after all as they already owned the Typing pool and Developers were just glorified Typists.

In a short period of time enslaved Developers from different Bussiness overlords had the latest Whiz-Bang software ready for production. Unfortunatly when the helper Gnomes took it to Production, one program corrupted the other and Production crashed causing an Outage!

The Developers in fear of reprisals pointed at each other and showed that it all worked on their machines! The Bussiness unable to accept any blame on itself and unable to comprehend that their greed had corrupted the system decided to blame the System Administrator!

System Administrator was appalled at the mess. He loved his computer and knew that it was good. He was loath to let cowboy code besmirch Production any further and instigated instigated rules and Commandments to protect it. These Commandments became the Operating Proceedures that a Developers needed to adhere to to get his code to Production, and System Administrator's helper Gnomes became know as the Operations department who would religiously ensure that the Operating Proceedurs were strictly enforced.

The Schism instigated by the Bussiness was complete. Developers and Operations would forever be pulled in different directions, devlopers were tasked with createing changes in Production and Operations would attempt to  prevent all change from sullying Production's pristeen uptime.

Problems continued to occur. One small mis-alignment of code or requirement or one mistep and the deployment process would flatten Production. Operations added more manuals and documentation to the wall that Developers had to get their code over to land in Production. Strange and infinitly varied proceedures begat equally varied  ways to get around them. 

## Dark Ages ...

Dispite or even due to the Schism, Software in Production was incredibly valuable to the Bussiness. In fact Computers flourished in the demand and became faster and faster, but such efficiency rather than satiating the Bussiness's greed furhter threw them into a feeding frenzy driving more demand.

In this turmoil the winners became super rich and loosers .... went out of bussiness or were consumed by the super wealthy. With so much at stake no-one wanted to slow down and think they just wanted code in Production.

Being compleatly IT illiterate many cargo cults, monsters and mythical creatures were invented by the Bussiness to try to explain or solve the problems in Production. For instance it was widely belived that Gremlins attacked computers leaving Bugs everywhere which caused Production crashes.

It was in this chaos and misunderstanding a saviour was though to exist in the form of a ruthless deamon, called a PM, that had been spawned and risen to the top of the fetering pit of the Tele-sales department. PM would be able to understand both the Bussiness desires and understand computer systems (after all he could use a predictive-dialing phone system) and so should be able to run am IT project or department. Or so it was thought.

However, PM's ambition was boundless. He neither knew nor cared how IT systems worked but he fully understood greed and power and he knew that the more people he could consume in his project the more power and weight he would have. His diabolical plan was to consume so much of The Bussiness that he'd become too big to fail and he'd be able to live forever on the misory of his victims. Born out of his success in Tele-Sales PM hatched a new monster the "Mythical Man-Month" to be his vessel. Using the Mythical Man Month he easily swayed The Bussiness that he just needed to consume more bodies and he could get code shipped to Production

Unfortunatly skilled Dev and Ops guys were expensive and hard to indoctinate
Other Bussinesses created Enterprise Systems were created in an attempt to mass-produce developers and Ops guys cheaply
